## About me

<img src="/img/about.jpg" class="about"/>

Hi, I'm Vicky, an illustrator, currently living in South-East London. I have just quit my very sensible job to study for a Graduate Diploma in Illustration at Camberwell College of the Arts. When I'm not drawing or studying, I'll most likely be thinking about food, reading a trashy thriller book, or watching over the top American TV with my boyfriend.
