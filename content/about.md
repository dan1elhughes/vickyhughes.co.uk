Hello! I’m a freelance illustrator with a love for telling stories, especially through editorial, branding, and attention grabbing GIFs and social media graphics.

I like to make things playful through endearing, big headed characters that make people smile or get them interested in a topic. I tend to use line work, a warm, reduced colour palette and some printmaking inspired textures, with pencil shading to add a bit of depth.

My favourite things to draw are playful people and their everyday lives, especially to do with work, food, animals, self-care and hobbies.

I’ve also got a background in maths, statistics and data science, and get a potentially odd satisfaction from digging into that old career knowledge and working with topics like tech, startups, data, scientific studies, finance, or business.

I’m currently available for work, please feel free to drop me an email: [vicky.hughes@hotmail.com](mailto:vicky.hughes@hotmail.com)!
