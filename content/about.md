Hello! I'm an illustrator and maker based in Leeds, creating adventurous, playful characters to empower and inspire. My work is influenced by travels in my campervan, and captures the joy of the outdoors and the power of independence.

Since graduating from Camberwell College of Arts, I have worked as a freelance illustrator across editorial, tech and publishing, as well as creating and selling illustrated goods. When I'm not on the road in the camper, I work from my home studio overlooking the garden, with diligent assistance from my rescue dog Kali. 

I'm currently available for freelance illustration work - [email me](mailto:vicky.hughes@hotmail.com) to get in touch! Or, if you'd like to buy illustrated products, [click here to sign up to my newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/8dcebb7ee0b4/shop-updates-signup-form) and be the first to get shop updates.
