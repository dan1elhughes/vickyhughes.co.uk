I create custom characterful illustrations to make growing brands stand out ðŸ’«

Based in Leeds, I design adventurous, playful graphics to empower and inspire. My work captures the joy of exploring and innovation, and the power of independence. I also have experience working in tech, SaaS and data so I know what makes startups tick!

Since **[graduating from Camberwell College of Arts](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/postgraduate-study/postgraduate-community/stories/spotlight-on-illustrator,-vicky-hughes)**, I have worked as a freelance illustrator across editorial, tech and publishing, as well as creating and selling illustrated goods. When Iâ€™m not on the road in my campervan, I work from my home studio overlooking the garden, with diligent assistance from my rescue dog Kali.

I'm currently available for freelance illustration work - **[email me](mailto:vicky.hughes@hotmail.com)** to get in touch!
