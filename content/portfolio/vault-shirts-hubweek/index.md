A treehouse themed teambuilding week t-shirt design for Vault.

*"Vicky is absolutely a joy to work with, and I frequently and wholeheartedly recommend her services. She has an innate ability to take a broad brief and come up with a range of clever and creative concepts that truly delight the intended audience — so much so, it’s sometimes difficult to narrow down on just one! Her creativity is married with a simple and seamless process, so each time I’ve worked with Vicky, I’m full of trust that not only will we have something on time, there are opportunities to feedback early (even on a tight deadline) and the end product (as proven) will be amazing."* - Monique Major, Head of People & Culture at Vault Platform.
