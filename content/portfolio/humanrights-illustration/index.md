I was contacted by Fine Acts and asked to create a poster on the theme of Reimagining Human Rights. This illustrated poster is available to use for free under a Creative Commons license allowing free non-commercial use and adaptation. You can find it on the Fine Acts 'The Greats' website [here.](https://thegreats.co/artworks/we-are-them-they-are-us)

I'm currently available for freelance illustration work - [email me](mailto::vicky.hughes@hotmail.com) to get in touch!
