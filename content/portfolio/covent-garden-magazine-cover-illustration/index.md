My entry for the Covent Gardener Winter 20-21 magazine cover competition. The theme was 'Covent Garden: Past and Present'. This illustrated design captures the spirit of the modern London market and its past as a fruit and vegetable marketplace. These days you're more likely to find coffee and some high end souvenirs!
