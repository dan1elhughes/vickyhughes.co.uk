_This is personal, uncommissioned work_.

A self-initiated brief of a poster for a Natural History Museum exhibition in London, 2021. The theme was Fantastic Beasts - both those from the wizarding world of the movies, and the real life creatures that have some of their own tricks. This poster was designed to appeal to children and young families. The animated poster edition provides a fun spot-the-animal game for kids and parents while waiting for the bus home!
