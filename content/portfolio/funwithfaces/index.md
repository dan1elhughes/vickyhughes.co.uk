I'm a sucker for Instagram challenges; this one's a personal favourite run by Charly Clements. Each day she has 3 prompts for you to make a portrait. It's called #funwithfaces, Charly's original challenge is [here](https://www.charlyclements.com/funwithfaces) and she's also got a Skillshare class with the same name.
