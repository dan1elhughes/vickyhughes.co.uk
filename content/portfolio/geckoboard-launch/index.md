I created an animated illustration for the lovely people at Geckoboard to announce their launch and rebrand - keeping the style in line with the collection of illustrations I have previously drawn for them. They are a tech startup based in Shoreditch. The animated illustration went out on the company social media channels in a variety of sizes and arrangements, and a static version too.
